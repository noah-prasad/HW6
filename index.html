            <article>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Noah Prasad. I am a third year student at the <span class="school">University of Iowa</span> studying Business Analytics and Information Systems. I am currently working at a restaurant in Iowa City called Big Grove Brewery. I work in the kitchen and have several different jobs that I can be scheduled for. I am mostly scheduled as a fry cook or a dishwasher, but I am also scheduled to work the grill, or make tacos on the inside set station on occasion. Aside from my job, I spend much of my time either attending classes or completing coursework. I spend much of my free time watching TV shows, movies, or sorts games with my roommates. I also spend a fair ammount of my free time playing video games, playing my trumpet, listening to music, and working out. That is just a bit about me, but if you would like to learn more, continue exploring my webpage!
